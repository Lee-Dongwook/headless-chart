# Installation

This section will guide you through the installation of **headless-chart** and the necessary Flitter dependencies. We'll also demonstrate how to run Flitter and headless-chart in a pure Vite setup and prepare you to integrate with frameworks like React.

## Setting Up Your Project

### 1. Create a New Vite Project

If you haven't already, start by creating a new Vite project. For example, to create a new Vite+React project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-chart-app -- --template react
cd my-chart-app
npm install
```

### 2. Install headless-chart and Flitter

headless-chart is built on Flitter, so you'll need both:

```bash
npm install @meursyphus/flitter @meursyphus/headless-chart
```

This gives you access to Flitter's widget system and the headless-chart components like BarChart.

## Running Flitter in a Pure Vite Environment

To run Flitter without any UI framework (just plain Vite + vanilla JS/TS), you can:

Import and initialize Flitter's AppRunner with an SVG or Canvas element in your main.js:

```js
import { AppRunner, Container, Text } from '@meursyphus/flitter';

const svgElement = document.getElementById('root'); // An <svg> element in your index.html
const runner = new AppRunner({ view: svgElement });

const widget = Container({
  width: 300,
  height: 200,
  color: "lightblue",
  child: Text("Flitter + Vite is running!")
});

runner.runApp(widget);
```

This approach does not require React or any additional frameworks.

## Integrating Flitter-React

For a more React-friendly approach, install flitter-react:

```bash
npm install @meursyphus/flitter-react
```

Then you can wrap your Flitter widgets in React components without manually handling refs or lifecycle events:

```jsx
import ReactWidget from "@meursyphus/flitter-react";
import { Container, Text } from "@meursyphus/flitter";

export default function App() {
  const widget = Container({
    width: 300,
    height: 200,
    color: "lightblue",
    child: Text("Hello from Flitter in React!")
  });

  return (
    <ReactWidget 
      width="100%" 
      height="300px" 
      widget={widget} 
      renderer="svg" 
    />
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

With headless-chart and Flitter installed, you're ready to create and customize charts. Next, we'll look at how to use Flitter-React more deeply and how to utilize headless-chart's customization features for building complex bar charts.
