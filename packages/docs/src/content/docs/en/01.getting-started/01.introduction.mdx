# Introduction

**headless-chart** is a highly customizable chart library built on top of the [Flitter](https://github.com/meursyphus/flitter) framework. It provides a powerful, **headless** way to define and compose charts. Unlike traditional chart libraries where you are constrained by predefined components, headless-chart gives you building blocks (in the form of Flitter widgets) that you can shape and style to meet your exact needs.

## Key Features

- **Full Customization:** Instead of tweaking chart options, you directly modify widget structures.  
- **Flitter-Powered Layout:** Automatic layout calculations, dual renderer support (SVG/Canvas), built-in interactions and animations are inherited from Flitter.  
- **Extendable & Flexible:** Compose your own bars, legends, axes, and grids by implementing custom widget functions.

In other words, headless-chart provides a chart "backbone" on top of Flitter's widget system, allowing you to build any type of chart with minimal restrictions.

## What You'll Learn

By following this guide, you will learn:

1. How to install and set up headless-chart in your project.  
2. How to integrate with Flitter and run your chart in a pure Vite environment.  
3. How to use `@meursyphus/flitter-react` to simplify rendering in React apps.  
4. The fundamental concepts of customizing chart components using `BarChartCustom` configurations.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic Knowledge of Flitter:** While headless-chart works seamlessly with Flitter, having a fundamental understanding of Flitter's widget system will be beneficial.  
- **React (Optional):** For those looking to integrate with React, a basic understanding of React is helpful, though not strictly required.

Let's get started by installing headless-chart and setting up our environment.
