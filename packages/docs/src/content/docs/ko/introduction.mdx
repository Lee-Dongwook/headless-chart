# Introduction to Flitter

Flitter is a powerful JavaScript rendering engine and framework inspired by Flutter, designed to create high-performance graphics and user interfaces in web applications. It supports both SVG and Canvas, making it ideal for implementing complex data visualizations, interactive charts, diagrams, and graphic editors.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Rendering Engine**: At its core, Flitter provides a sophisticated rendering engine that gives developers precise control over how elements are drawn and updated on the screen.

- **Render Object Tree**: Flitter uses a render object tree for efficient rendering, allowing easy management and manipulation of complex layouts. This approach enables optimized updates and redraws.

- **Declarative Programming**: Following a declarative paradigm, the screen automatically updates when values change, simplifying application state management and reducing the complexity of manual DOM manipulation.

- **Optimized Rendering Pipeline**: Re-rendering, painting, and layout recalculations are managed by the renderer pipeline, with optimizations applied to update only necessary parts. This ensures high performance even with complex, data-heavy visualizations.

- **Box Model Layout**: Users can easily compose layouts using the familiar Box model, providing an intuitive way to structure complex UIs within the rendering engine.

- **Dual Renderer Support**: As a flexible rendering engine, Flitter supports both SVG and Canvas, meeting various graphic requirements. Developers can choose the appropriate renderer as needed, switching seamlessly between vector and bitmap graphics.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Flitter's architecture promotes reusability and maintainability through a component-based approach.

## Showcase

Here are some examples of what you can create with Flitter:

This interactive ERD demonstrates Flitter's capability to create complex, interactive diagrams. Users can manipulate entities, add relationships, and visualize database structures in real-time. This showcase highlights Flitter's strengths in:

- Creating responsive, draggable elements
- Handling complex user interactions
- Rendering intricate diagrams with ease
- Providing real-time updates based on user input

## Why Choose Flitter?

1. **Powerful Rendering Engine**: Flitter's core strength lies in its advanced rendering capabilities, allowing for smooth handling of complex graphics and animations.

2. **Familiar Syntax**: Uses syntax similar to Flutter, allowing mobile developers to easily adapt to the web environment while leveraging a powerful web-based rendering engine.

3. **High Performance**: The optimized rendering pipeline ensures smooth performance even with complex, data-intensive visualizations.

4. **Flexibility**: Abstracts SVG and Canvas manipulation, allowing developers to focus on business logic while the rendering engine handles the low-level drawing operations.

5. **Renderer Selection**: Choose between SVG and Canvas renderers as needed, meeting various graphic requirements and allowing for the best performance in different scenarios.

6. **Code Reusability**: Increases code reusability through a component-based approach, enabled by the underlying rendering engine's architecture.

7. **Cross-Platform Potential**: While primarily for web, Flitter's Flutter-inspired design opens possibilities for easier cross-platform development in the future.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example to get you started with Flitter:

```javascript
import { Container, Text, TextStyle, AppRunner } from '@meursyphus/flitter';

const app = new AppRunner({
  view: document.getElementById('app'),
});

app.runApp(
  Container({
    color: 'lightblue',
    child: Text('Hello, Flitter!', {
      style: new TextStyle({ fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold' })
    })
  })
);
```

This example creates a simple app with a light blue background and centered text.
